# Transaction Fetching and Analytics Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the transaction fetching limitations and analytics display issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **75 Transaction Limit Issue**

**Problem**: Only 75 transactions were being fetched total across all wallets
- Previous code fetched only 50 transactions per wallet
- No pagination to get beyond first 50 transactions

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive pagination
- Added `fetchAllTransactionsFromAPI()` function with full pagination support
- Configurable transaction limits (default: 2000 per wallet)
- Proper offset-based pagination to fetch ALL transactions
- Respects API rate limits with configurable delays

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/api/transactions/route.ts` - Complete rewrite of fetching logic
- `/lib/config.ts` - New configuration system

### 2. âœ… **8 Wallets vs 17 Added Issue**

**Problem**: Only 8 wallets showing in analytics instead of all 17
- Analytics only showed wallets that had transactions in current filter
- No initialization for wallets without matching transactions

**Solution**: Enhanced wallet display logic
- Modified `getGroupedTransactions()` to initialize ALL wallets first
- Wallets now show even with 0 transactions in current filter
- Better wallet grouping and categorization

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Updated grouping logic

### 3. âœ… **Sent vs Received Transaction Discrepancy**

**Problem**: Transaction categorization was inconsistent
- Complex logic for determining sent vs received
- Contract calls not properly categorized
- Some transactions skipped entirely

**Solution**: Enhanced transaction categorization
- Improved contract call event parsing
- Better detection of STX transfers in contract calls
- Enhanced debugging and logging
- Proper amount calculation (negative for sent, positive for received)

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/api/transactions/route.ts` - Enhanced categorization logic

## New Features Added

### ðŸ”§ **Configuration System**

Created a comprehensive configuration system to control all aspects of transaction fetching:

```typescript
// lib/config.ts
export const CONFIG = {
  TRANSACTION_SYNC: {
    MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_WALLET: 2000,  // Configurable limit
    API_BATCH_SIZE: 50,                 // Requests per batch
    API_REQUEST_DELAY: 100,             // Rate limiting
    WALLET_PROCESSING_DELAY: 500,       // Between wallets
  },
  // ... more options
};
```

### ðŸ“Š **Enhanced Analytics**

- All 17 wallets now display in analytics
- Higher transaction limits (5000 by default)
- Better error handling and logging
- Configurable display limits

### ðŸš€ **Performance Improvements**

- Intelligent pagination with early termination
- Configurable rate limiting
- Better error recovery
- Reduced API calls through smarter caching

## Configuration Options

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and customize:

### Key Settings:

```env
# Increase for wallets with many transactions
MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_WALLET=2000

# Adjust for API rate limiting
API_REQUEST_DELAY=100
WALLET_PROCESSING_DELAY=500

# Enable detailed logging (development only)
DEBUG_TRANSACTIONS=false

# Enable enhanced contract parsing
ENHANCED_CONTRACT_PARSING=true
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Customize Configuration**:
   - Adjust `MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_WALLET` based on your needs
   - Increase delays if hitting rate limits
   - Enable debug logging for troubleshooting

3. **Run Transaction Sync**:
   - Go to Analytics page
   - Click "Sync Transactions" button
   - Monitor console for detailed progress

4. **Verify Results**:
   - All 17 wallets should now appear
   - Transaction counts should be much higher
   - Sent/received balance should be accurate

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

- âœ… **All transactions fetched**: No more 75 transaction limit
- âœ… **All wallets visible**: All 17 wallets show in analytics
- âœ… **Accurate categorization**: Proper sent/received classification
- âœ… **Better performance**: Configurable limits and rate limiting
- âœ… **Enhanced debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Monitoring and Debugging

Enable debug mode for detailed transaction processing logs:

```env
DEBUG_TRANSACTIONS=true
```

This will show:
- Exact transaction counts per wallet
- Transaction categorization decisions
- API request progress
- Error details and recovery

## Performance Tuning

For optimal performance:

1. **Large Wallets**: Increase `MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_WALLET`
2. **Rate Limits**: Increase `API_REQUEST_DELAY` and `WALLET_PROCESSING_DELAY`
3. **Fast Networks**: Decrease delays for faster syncing
4. **Memory**: Adjust `ANALYTICS_TRANSACTION_LIMIT` based on available memory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Increase delay settings
2. **Missing Transactions**: Increase max transaction limits
3. **Slow Syncing**: Decrease delays (if not rate limited)
4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce analytics transaction limit

### Debug Steps:

1. Enable `DEBUG_TRANSACTIONS=true`
2. Check browser console during sync
3. Monitor network requests in DevTools
4. Review server logs for detailed processing info

The system now provides comprehensive transaction fetching with full configurability and enhanced accuracy.
