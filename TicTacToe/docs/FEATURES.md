# New Smart Contract Features

## Tournament System (On-Chain Core)

### Tournament Contract
```clarity
(define-map tournaments
  uint ;; tournament-id
  {
    creator: principal,
    max-players: uint,
    entry-fee: uint,
    prize-pool: uint,
    status: (string-ascii 20), ;; "registration", "active", "completed"
    winner: (optional principal),
    participants: (list 32 principal),
    current-round: uint,
    created-at: uint
  }
)
```

### Core Tournament Functions
- `create-tournament` - Initialize tournament with entry fee
- `join-tournament` - Player registration with fee payment
- `advance-tournament` - Move winners to next round
- `distribute-tournament-prizes` - Automatic prize distribution

### Tournament Types (Smart Contract Support)
```clarity
;; Tournament configurations
(define-constant TOURNAMENT-SINGLE-ELIMINATION u1)
(define-constant TOURNAMENT-DOUBLE-ELIMINATION u2)
(define-constant TOURNAMENT-ROUND-ROBIN u3)

(define-map tournament-configs
  uint ;; tournament-type
  {
    min-players: uint,
    max-players: uint,
    rounds-required: uint
  }
)
```

## Player Statistics (Essential On-Chain Data)

### Player Registry
```clarity
(define-map players
  principal
  {
    games-played: uint,
    games-won: uint,
    games-lost: uint,
    games-drawn: uint,
    total-winnings: uint,
    total-losses: uint,
    elo-rating: uint,
    tournaments-won: uint,
    joined-at: uint,
    last-active: uint
  }
)
```

### Rating System (On-Chain)
- **ELO rating calculation** (trustless competitive rankings)
- **Win/loss/draw tracking** (essential for matchmaking)
- **Total winnings/losses** (financial history)
- **Tournament performance** (competitive achievements)

### ELO Rating Functions
```clarity
(define-private (calculate-elo-change (winner-rating uint) (loser-rating uint) (k-factor uint))
(define-private (update-player-elo (winner principal) (loser principal))
(define-read-only (get-player-elo (player principal))
```

## Advanced Game Modes

### Multi-Game Series
```clarity
(define-map game-series
  uint ;; series-id
  {
    player-one: principal,
    player-two: principal,
    games-to-win: uint,
    player-one-wins: uint,
    player-two-wins: uint,
    current-game: (optional uint),
    winner: (optional principal),
    series-bet: uint,
    created-at: uint
  }
)
```

### Series Functions
- `create-game-series` - Best of N games
- `play-series-game` - Individual game within series
- `complete-series` - Series winner determination
- `claim-series-prize` - Prize distribution

### Timed Games
```clarity
;; Add to game data
(define-map timed-games
  uint ;; game-id
  {
    time-per-move: uint, ;; seconds per move
    player-one-time: uint, ;; remaining time
    player-two-time: uint, ;; remaining time
    last-move-timestamp: uint
  }
)
```

### Time Control Functions
- **Move deadline enforcement** (automatic loss on timeout)
- **Time bank management** (track remaining time)
- **Blitz mode support** (rapid games)

## Economic Features (On-Chain)

### Staking Mechanism
```clarity
(define-map player-stakes
  principal
  {
    staked-amount: uint,
    stake-timestamp: uint,
    reward-multiplier: uint,
    last-claim: uint
  }
)
```

### Staking Functions
```clarity
(define-public (stake-tokens (amount uint))
(define-public (unstake-tokens (amount uint))
(define-public (claim-staking-rewards))
(define-read-only (calculate-staking-rewards (player principal))
```

### Platform Economics
```clarity
;; Platform treasury
(define-data-var platform-treasury uint u0)
(define-data-var total-staked uint u0)
(define-data-var reward-pool uint u0)

;; Fee distribution
(define-map fee-distribution
  (string-ascii 20) ;; fee-type
  uint ;; percentage in basis points
)
```

### Economic Functions
- **Fee collection and distribution**
- **Staking rewards calculation**
- **Tournament prize pools**
- **Treasury management**

## Game Variants (Contract Support)

### Board Size Variants
```clarity
(define-constant BOARD-3X3 u9)
(define-constant BOARD-4X4 u16)
(define-constant BOARD-5X5 u25)

(define-map game-variants
  uint ;; variant-id
  {
    board-size: uint,
    win-condition: uint, ;; cells in row to win
    max-moves: uint
  }
)
```

### Custom Game Rules
```clarity
(define-map custom-games
  uint ;; game-id
  {
    variant-id: uint,
    special-rules: (list 5 (string-ascii 50)),
    rule-parameters: (list 5 uint)
  }
)
```

## Smart Contract Events

### Game Events
```clarity
;; Game lifecycle events
(define-private (emit-game-created (game-id uint) (player principal) (bet uint)))
(define-private (emit-game-joined (game-id uint) (player principal)))
(define-private (emit-move-made (game-id uint) (player principal) (position uint)))
(define-private (emit-game-completed (game-id uint) (winner (optional principal))))
(define-private (emit-game-abandoned (game-id uint) (claimer principal)))
```

### Tournament Events
```clarity
;; Tournament lifecycle events
(define-private (emit-tournament-created (tournament-id uint) (creator principal)))
(define-private (emit-tournament-joined (tournament-id uint) (player principal)))
(define-private (emit-tournament-started (tournament-id uint)))
(define-private (emit-tournament-completed (tournament-id uint) (winner principal)))
```

### Economic Events
```clarity
;; Economic events
(define-private (emit-stake-created (player principal) (amount uint)))
(define-private (emit-rewards-claimed (player principal) (amount uint)))
(define-private (emit-fee-collected (amount uint) (fee-type (string-ascii 20))))
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Gas Optimization
- **Efficient data structures** for large tournaments
- **Batch operations** for multiple games
- **Event-driven architecture** for off-chain processing

### Security Measures
- **Input validation** for all user data
- **Overflow protection** for mathematical operations
- **Access control** for administrative functions
- **Reentrancy guards** for financial operations

### Scalability Features
- **Modular contract design** for easy upgrades
- **Event indexing** for efficient queries
- **State pruning** for historical data
- **Cross-contract communication** for complex features
